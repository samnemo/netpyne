Contribute ancillary code
=======================================

Ancillary code contributions will most typically be additional analysis and/or plotting code to be used with NetPyNE output files. This is separate from
NetPyNE source code. Contribution to source code is also encouraged and is desribed `here <https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_. 
Sometimes new analysis Python code may also require adding new output formats to NetPyNE so that both contributions may be made together.

Other ancillary contributions might include new Tutorials for specific purposes or NEURON procedural code for augmenting the declarative code in a
netParams file for complex parameter settings.

Code should be hosted by the user on a publicly-accessible github page with complete documentation (and strong code commenting). Submissions should then be made in the `NetPyNE forum
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/netpyne-forum>`_ with a brief description of the package for listing here.
